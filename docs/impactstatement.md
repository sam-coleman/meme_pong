# Software Impact Statement
This project was split into two distinct phases which impacted both our process and our final product. This  idea began as our project for an interactive programming mini project. However, that same day, Olin announced all students would have to leave campus and we would be virtual for the remainder of the semester due to COVID-19. This was devestating, and the mini-project became creating the basic strucutre and classes of an MVP, while the final project became the full creation and implementation.

The basic version of pong and the mini-game are enjoyable for the general population. On the other hand, only the Olin population will get an added level of enjoyment from the meme-ified skin of Pong. Given how everyone in the Olin community are longing to all be back together, we wanted to focus on making it Olin specific. Something we can do in the future is create an option for it to be Olin or general and make the easter eggs related to something everyone would understand. Not understanding the skin doesn't take away from the game, it just doesn't add extra value.
