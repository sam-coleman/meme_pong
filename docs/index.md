# Project Overview
This is a game of pong with easter egg memes created as the final project for Olin College of Engineering Software Design Spring 2020. With inspiration grabbed from the classic game of Pong, we wanted to put our own "Olin" spin on it. The right player can go off screen, and unlock a mini-adventure game. Once the "key" is grabbed, they are brought back to the main game and a surprise awaits them.
