# Project Overview and inspiration
This is a game of pong with easter egg memes created as the final project for Olin College of Engineering Software Design Spring 2020. With inspiration grabbed from the classic game of Pong, we wanted to put our own "Olin" spin on it. The right player can go off screen, and unlock a mini-adventure game. Once the "key" is grabbed, they are brought back to the main game and a surprise awaits them.

Our hope is that this game can give the Olin community a bit of joy and laughter during the tough times of COVID-19. Olin is such a small, tight-knit family and it is difficult for us all to be apart right now. Olin faculty and students alike have had a positive reaction to the meme aspect of Meme Pong. By including Olin memes, it can help Oliners feel closer together during these times.
